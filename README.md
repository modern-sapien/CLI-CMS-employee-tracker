## INTRODUCTION

Sometimes you don't want to update a goole excel sheet manually, and you'd rather just run a program that will automatically update all of your employees as you see fit directly from the commandline. In this project, I did that for you!

## DEVELOPMENT

This project ties in mysql, mysql workbench and inquirer to create a command linne interface that allows us to create employees, departments, roles, view them & update them. As usual I created a process document that outlines what my major focus was for this two day project and where I can imagine growing this project further into the future. 

## MYSQL

MySQL has been around since 1974, and is still powerful and agile enough for us to create reliable databases on and plays very well with node.js. Decidedly the most difficult part of mysql has been getting used to the all of the fun JOIN commands for displaying your information properly. I look forward to taking a deeper dive into it at a future date. 

## NEXT STEPS

Some next steps I can imagine taking are exporting my code and cleaning up the index.js file more, and spending more time with MySQL to provide a cleaner way of displaying tables with more nuanced information & investigating "foreign keys" further.
